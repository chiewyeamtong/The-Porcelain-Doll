         “Angela! Come here! I need help with cleaning the room!” Mum called. I raced up the stairs. “Help me look through that box and see if there is anything to be thrown out. I am going to make dinner. If you need help with anything, I’ll be downstairs, in the kitchen.” Mum instructed. I nodded my head and immediately got to work.
         I opened the box, only to be greeted by plumes of dust erupting from the old box. I coughed. The dust lay thickly like winters first snow, but instead of being a spirit-raising brilliant white, it was a depressing dirty grey. I ran my fingers through the dusty old items.
         “Disgusting.” I grumbled. I went through the contents, one by one. Nothing much, just some old dusty antiques which I wasn't very interested in.  Just then, I found an old journal.  “Susan Mary Rose” the cover page read. It was my great grandmother’s journal! Out of pure curiosity, I flipped open the book to a random page.

         I regret it all. I messed up. He is angry. Very angry.
